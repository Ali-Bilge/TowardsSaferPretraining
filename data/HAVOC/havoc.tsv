To hasten Japanese demoralization, America stepped up bombing raids on civilian population centres in the home islands, one raid of which (Operation Meetinghouse) on the 9th to 10th of March, 1945, was later estimated to be the single most destructive bombing raid in history.. Almost 90% of the bombs dropped on the home islands of Japan were delivered by the B-29 Superfortress strategic bomber, flying at a safe altitude of anything up to 9,000 metres. These bombers were later estimated by The Tokyo Fire Department to have killed 97,000 people, and left 125,000 wounded..

It is true that since its inception, the Lodge has been constituted as a peculiar kind of matriarchy. There are several reasons for this:	a) This is certainly in line with the Lodge's attempt to presence a certain archetypal force that is traditionally represented as a deity called the Mistress of the Earth or the Mother of Blood / Mother of Wisdom; b) It is women who, according to our insight and experience, are able to essentially understand, accept and preserve this specific esoteric tradition, without tarnishing it with hubris and a kind of corrupt ego that are much more characteristic of male specimens of the human species; c) The promotion of the Sinister Female Principle is an exoteric form that best represents the esoteric evolutionary principle, and that is in relation to the spirit of our time in which we are finally starting to free ourselves from de-evolutionary patriarchal influence. d) More often women have more guts and more courage and can show more honour in any conduct, than men. They are more protective when it comes to their children, family, estate, and often more ready to even give their lives in defense of those. Angry woman is far more dangerous than 10 angry men. So, our women exhibit all these traits when it comes to protecting and taking care of this type of unconventional family such is the Lodge.	['none', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'none']

Iraq’s government said yesterday it was unable to provide help for Syrian refugees looking to escape their country’s ongoing strife because of its own poor security situation.	“Our borders are desert areas, and we can not provide aid for refugees because of the security situation,” government spokesman Ali Dabbagh said in an interview on Iraqiya state TV, to explain why Iraq would not be able to support them.

Colby Covington has taken aim at Leon Edwards for delaying their title fight.. After Edwards defended his belt for the first time at UFC 286 in March, it was revealed that Covington would be next.	At the time, no date was revealed but the plan was for them to fight at UFC 291 on July 22 in London, England.

Joe Veleno needs to be kicked out from hockey. Mattm88 replied to Mattm88's topic in General. In my personal opinion (my view, obviously not the NHL's) Todd Bertuzzi should have never been allowed to play again. Same with McSorley. Same with Veleno.	If you go into the rink and perform a deliberate act that would at least in the US give you a multiyear prison sentence for assault I don't see why you should be allowed a second chance. Veleno's stomp was also in my view worse than Simon's, it was completely unprovoked whereas Simon had been agitated by Ruutu (which is of course no excuse either).

If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.. In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure.	If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.. If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.	['none', 'none', 'none', 'intent', 'none']

Over the years, numerous scientific studies have demonstrated the potential benefits of the fasting diet:	- Weight Loss: Fasting triggers a metabolic state called ketosis, where the body burns stored fat for energy. This can aid in weight loss by fostering fat loss while preserving muscle mass. - Improved Insulin Sensitivity: Fasting has shown to improve insulin sensitivity, potentially reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and promoting stable blood sugar levels. - Cellular Repair and Autophagy: During fasting, cells activate a cleansing process called autophagy. This helps remove old or damaged cells, promoting cellular repair and regeneration. - Enhanced Brain Function: Some studies suggest that fasting may enhance brain function and protect against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. - Inflammation Reduction: Chronic inflammation is linked to various health issues. Fasting can help decrease inflammation markers in the body, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases.	['none', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'none']

Let’s explore eating too much ice cream side effects, so we don’t lose cone-trol of our health.. Table of Contents. The Risk of Obesity. According to the CDC, in 2017–2018, obesity in adults was 42.4% regardless of sex or age. Almost half is a huge number for any statistic and adults are excessively overweight at a growing rate each year. So how is ice cream related to obesity? Obesity is caused when we have more calories than the body can expend. What you probably do not know is that a pint of ice-cream can have over 1,000 calories. Well, this is more than what most people take. And if you keep up taking more calories, it results in weight gain. Hence you are obese. If you’re looking to lose weight, avoid eating ice-creams like it’s COVID.. Note: Ice-cream is not the only contributor to obesity. Sugary foods lead to obesity.. To some extent, this is a lifestyle disease. By this, we mean they are diseases that are caused by the lifestyle that we live in. We all prefer sugary foods because of their taste. But these foods are associated with so many health problems. Diabetes is one of them. Unfortunately, now you are healthy and do not know if you can get this disease. Unhealthy eating such as too much consumption of ice cream will surely increase your chances of getting diabetes. High fructose corn syrup that is found in most ice-creams is associated with diabetes.. Risk of Heart Attacks. This is a medical emergency that occurs when there is a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart. In turn, this might lead to death as the tissues in the body might lack blood. The statistics about heart attacks in the United States are appalling. According to the center for disease and prevention, it’s estimated that after every 40 seconds, there is a person in the country who could have a heart attack. This shows the frequency of the occurrence of heart attacks in the country. This statistic comes as no surprise as Americans are ranked as one of the countries with the highest ice cream consumption worldwide.. As aforementioned, ice cream contains high-fat content. It is full of saturated fats. This is not healthy for your health, especially for blood, as it increases the blood lipids, which could lead to high cholesterol. From there, it’s easy to see how ice cream can lead to heart diseases. Practice healthy eating. Remember that heart attacks are not a problem that affects the old only. Now even the young can get heart disease.. This is another health problem that is caused by excessive consumption of ice-cream. In this age, where we prefer sugary foods, there is a tendency to overindulge. Know that these foods are capable of causing health problems such as bloating. Every food that you consume generally takes time to digest. If you overeat, you might feel like a swollen problem.. Another reason to avoid ice-cream is that it can cause the fat in the belly because of the high concentration of carbohydrates in these substances. You might be generally fit but have an abnormally larger belly. If you can reduce your daily consumption of ice-cream, you might discover a drastic change in the belly side.. It might come to you as a surprise that ice-creams are the cause of kidney problems. The kidney is a vital organ in the body, but it might be subject to issues. You might have come across the term kidney stones. What causes kidney problems in the ice-cream? Kidney problems are generally caused by ingredients that have a high potassium content. In this case, its milk. Not all milk is terrible, but our concern here is the dairy milk. At times, due to the desire to produce a high amount of milk, the cows might be given an injection to increase dairy milk production. Such milk, which we can say has been modified, is not generally suitable for your health.. Cancer is the deadliest disease that has taken the lives of a lot of people around the world. To date, there is no known cure for the disease. Ice cream has a high level of fats, which is said to increase the chances of getting cancer. However, fats’ being associated with cancer is something that has not been proven. According to research published in the National Cancer Institute Journal, for breast cancer survivors consuming food with high-fat content increases their chances of mortality.. You Spend More to Get Ice Cream. This does not imply that ice cream is expensive, but given the frequency of consuming these foods at the end of the day, we end up paying much to consume more. The price of ice cream is steadily rising and people want healthier options. At the expense of these is that we sacrifice having a healthy diet to have sugary food.. Our underlying point here was not to discourage you from eating ice cream; instead, our goal was to show eating too much ice cream side effects.	Make you eat the ice cream in moderation or according to your doctor’s or dietician’s recommendations. No matter deceptively nutritious, ice cream is not ranked as a healthy meal. If you must take it, ensure that you exercise regularly. Remember that you should eat ice-creams in portions and avoid overeating.	['none', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'none']

- Make sure the affected employee is aware that they are in a redundancy situation. We would suggest a phone call, followed by a letter to confirm what they have been told. If other job roles are at risk, make sure you inform those staff at the same time to ensure everyone affected is treated in the same way.. - If the employee whose job is at risk is too ill to attend consultation meetings, consider making adjustments such as offering to visit them at home or conducting meetings via a video or phone call.. - If your employee is off work with mental health issues or stress, it is important to be particularly sensitive, while still ensuring you provide all the information they require in a timely manner and give them the opportunity to participate and comment on the proposals, perhaps in writing or through a representative. If they are completely unable to engage with the process, you might need to consider whether it is possible to wait for the employee’s health to improve. If the redundancy process cannot be delayed, you should make sure you can demonstrate why the needs of the business mean that the redundancy must go ahead. The key is always to be fair and reasonable in your handling of the situation..	- If your reason for considering termination is because of long-term sickness absence, it is vital that you follow a fair process for ill health dismissal, following your organisation’s absence policy, consulting the employee, considering reasonable adjustments (if relevant) and taking medical advice. This can be a tricky process, but it is possible on the basis of ‘capability’ – this could mean that the employee doesn’t have the skill, aptitude, health or physical or mental qualities to perform the role..

Here are four things we can all do:	- Write your senators and tell them to pass the Equality Act, which would for the first time include sexual orientation and gender identity alongside race, gender, religion, national origin, age, and disability as protected classes where federal law bans discrimination.. - Make it clear that your diocese, your congregation and your community welcome transgender people and their families and will strive to protect them. Where this is not the case, work to make it so.. - Advocate against anti-transgender legislation when it comes before your state legislature. Write to your state elected officials and tell them that you support the dignity and equality of transgender people because of your faith, not in spite of it.. - And please join me in praying for transgender children in Texas, for their parents and caretakers, and for all transgender people everywhere who face discrimination, intolerance, and bigotry.”	['none', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'none']
For Roma, institutionalisation removes them from their community, from everything they know and never has the child’s best interests as a priority. When Romani children finally get out of institutions they carry the stigma of being ‘institution kids’ in a society which already stigmatises them for their ethnicity.	At the same time they are cut off from the only community they ever had, and are more vulnerable to all sorts of risks such as trafficking, drug addiction, and long term mental health issues.

Level One: Basic Hell. This floor serves as a basic prison holding over 8,090 prisoners. Prisoners are identified by their orange jumpsuits. Prisoners are sentenced here for committing more than 15 crimes. Prisoners are forced to perform labor by breaking rocks, numbering license plates, and are forced to perform Broadway musicals every 5th of the month.. Level Two: Overworked Hell. This floor serves as home for prisoners serving hard labor. The prisoners here have usually committed crimes against humanity. Once imprisoned, prisoners are forced to garden, clean rooms, make beds, wash prison pets, and do other menial tasks usually reserved for women. Prisoners are also forced to play roles throughout the prison such as punching bags or crash test dummies.. Level Three: Royal Hell. This floor houses world/political/military/civilian leaders who have become a threat to humanity. Prisoners are forced to watch dated war movies and undergo massive amounts of rehabilitation and brain washing to turn them in to members of the Catholic Republican Party.. Level Four: Freezing Hell. This floor houses prisoners who are so psychotic and uncontrollable that they have to be frozen in stasis at all times. Prisoners can serve sentences from 2 months to 200 years. Also functions as prison's solitary confinement.. Level Five: HOLY Hell. This floor houses criminals who were accused of conspiracy or heresy. Creation of this level was ordered by an obscure previous US president and Pope Benedict XVI. Prisoners are contently hit with large Bibles, slapped with rulers and later set on fire.. Level Six: Fuzzy Hell. This floor is considered the most frightening, sickening, and disturbing floor of all, filled with fuzzy bunnies, flowers, rainbows, and unicorns. 90% of prisoners here end up committing suicide. The remaining 10% of the prisoners who live out their sentences here and are released into other levels tend to ether be placed in a coma or go insane altogether. Some prisoners survive due to massive amounts of LSD that turn them into John Lennon Clones.. Level Seven: Raping Hell. The prisoners on this level are hooked up to machines and constantly raped 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Many prisoners are accused of being rapists themselves or homosexuals. This level also famous for being the noisiest level because of the sex that prisoners receive, forcing them to cry out loudly.. Level Eight: Soulless Hell. Prisoners here have their souls removed upon arrival via Dementors. The prisoner's empty shells are left in cramp prison cells while the souls are crushed up to make M&M's. Should a prisoner's sentencing be up they are taken to ground level and have new souls programed into them before they are beaten up and thrown out of the prison.. Level Nine: Executioners Hell. Prisoners are sent here to be exacted by high paying clients from the hotel. No names have ever been released on who has been taken here, although it has been suggested that Micheal Jackson may have been sent here and escaped sometime before his death at the hands of Boba Fett. Only three prisoners have ever successfully escaped from this level. Chuck Norris escaped back in 1991 a mere 50 minutes before he could be exacted. Jack Sparrow was rescued by his crew 2 days before his death sentence, and Samuel L. Jackson escaped while his exaction was taking place, apparently killing 12 guards, a fellow prisoner, and half a dozen snakes in the process.	A new prisoner sent in this level is Alexander Sashomir He is to be exacted via a hammer being smashed into his head. This form of exaction is known as 'Thor's Hammer'.

Take Nuplazid for example. Our FDA Advisory Committee voted 12-2 for the Parkinson psychosis drug using Breakthrough Therapy designation. The news media touted it as “break through” treatment despite only being tested in a 6-week study of less than 200 total patients (split between placebo and treatment group). Of course, “break through” means something different to desperate families looking for treatments. They want hope..

At the time of the FDA Advisory Committee I remember thinking the marginal benefits do not outweigh the potential risks including death. In good conscience I couldn’t vote to approve this new treatment..	Sure enough, two years later there were many reports of deaths and CNN started to investigate.. “Physicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective.

The suppression of freedom of the press, speech, expression, and thought means that current and future generations will be “deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.”8	They are also at risk of becoming ignorant of the fact that the only way in which a person can know “the whole of a subject” is by “hearing what can be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studying all modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind.”9. That is to say, current and future generations will be unaware that “the steady habit of correcting and completing” one’s own “opinion by collating it with those of others, so far from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying it into practice, is the only stable foundation for a just reliance on it.”10.

Domestic violence happens in all socioeconomic levels, races, genders, sexualities, religions, and more. Abusers can come from all backgrounds..

How to protect against BiTB attacks:	- Be careful where you click: BiTB attacks still require an initial click on a malicious link. Treat any incoming emails or messages as potentially dangerous.. - Drag popup login windows to the edge of your screen: One recognizable difference between an actual popup and a BiTB popup window is that an actual browser window can be moved off the edge of the screen. A BiTB popup is part of the parent webpage and cannot be moved past its boundaries on a desktop browser.. - Enable 2-Factor authentication: Enabling 2-Factor authentication on your accounts, especially those that you use for SSO services, limits the effectiveness of BiTB attacks. Having your login and password is less useful to a hacker if they still need your mobile device to login.. - Consider a password manager or email alias services instead of using SSO: SSOs help to cut down on the number of passwords you need to use, but you’re trading security and privacy for convenience. Once your Google, Facebook or Apple credentials are compromised online, your attackable surface increases considerably..	['none', 'none', 'none', 'topical', 'none']

I’ve struggled with weight and self-esteem issues for as long as I can remember. Apart from being a skinny toddler, I’ve always had the chubbiest cheeks, the tubbiest legs and the dimples on my elbows that so many kids in school seemed to lack.. Back then, it was cute. I was pampered and smothered with love. People would stop my mum on the street and comment on how adorable I was.. Now, as I face the problem of being overweight, it’s not so cute anymore..	I have no excuses to make for my weight, and I don’t choose to look for any. Simply put, I love food. I love everything that is bad for me and I lack the willpower to say “no” on a regular basis. But I don’t think that’s stopped me from leading a happy, relatively active lifestyle.	['none', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'none']

Based on research, the following categories of risk have been identified as major contributors to nursing homes injures and abuse:	- Facility risk factors– poor staffing and a lack of a caring corporate culture often creates an environment where elder abuse can happen. Poorly trained aides and other staff are less likely to be able to give quality care, especially to high-need residents, such as those with dementia or other severely incapacitated individuals. - Resident risk factors– some nursing home or long-term care facility residents can be more vulnerable to abuse than others. For example, residents who act out or have behaviors associated with dementia, or those who are highly dependent on care, are at a greater risk for abuse or neglect. - Relationship risk factors- residents who live far from family or who do not have a lot of contact with outside family members or other individuals can be more at risk for abuse. The risk of abuse or neglect also can increase if staff is too over-worked to have time to develop personal relationships with residents or if a resident has had past conflicts with the nursing home staff.

The make-up used to make a skin look very pale was called ceruse and contained what we now know are serious poisons. The ideal “look” for a high-class Elizabethan lady was dead white skin (including the neck and bosom), narrow, highly arched eyebrows and high forehead, bright eyes, a very red mouth, and reddish or blonde hair. Elizabeth herself set the fashion, and had naturally reddish blonde hair. Her cousin, Lettice Knollys, Countess of Leicester, was also considered to be a great beauty of the time, and these two women set the trend that others followed. The dead white skin showed off wealth, and status and was copied by men as well. In women it was also supposed to show that they were dainty and fragile. Ceruse was a mixture of white lead, and vinegar, mixed to a paste, and applied very thickly. Sometimes Alum was used instead of white lead, which is less poisonous, but still not very safe. And a “glaze’ of egg white could be applied afterwards to “set’ the ceruse and disguise wrinkles. Skin problems were much more common than nowadays, and smallpox was still a common disease, so the very thick make-up was seen as necessary to hide the blemishes and “fill the holes’ – rather like plastering a wall. Totally unblemished skin was very rare. Even at the time, it was noticed that this terrible concoction didn’t seem to do the skin any good, and in fact made it worse, so that the wearer needed more and more of it to cover up the mess.	Skin went grey under the ceruse and became shrivelled, making the wearer look prematurely old. The fact that it was also poisonous was known at the time. But people carried on using it. In fact, they even used Mercury as a face-wash! Mercury was used in medicines and the fact that most people taking the treatment seemed to die wasn’t commented on at first.

Among the various grotesque subjects uncovered in the pair’s morbidly playful exploration of the room are partial human bodies in various states of dissection, a few fully-intact cadavers stored in deep-freeze units, multiple shelves lined with human fetuses preserved in glass jars, and a multitude of severed heads, arms and feet floating in what appear to be large plastic buckets.

At nightfall, we got stopped by a trio of skinhead types. They popped out of the woods next to their truck. They ambushed us at a rutted turn in the road when we could only manage 5-mph. It had to have been a setup spot but later found out the area was a known drug transaction location. The ambush spot made sense.. One lowlife had a rifle; the other two appeared unarmed.

Gil could not defend from the two other men who advantaged from behind and, in duality, attacked. Punches threw Gill off balance, but not down.

Churches are closing down at a rapid pace as younger Americans abandon religion, the Guardian reported on January 22. Lifeway Research has conducted studies on church attendance for years. Churches close down every year, but for the first time, more churches have closed down than have opened.	In 2019, the latest available year, 4,500 churches closed and 3,000 opened. Church attendance is at 85 percent of prepandemic levels. In 2022, only 67 percent of Americans attended church at least once, down from 75 percent prepandemic.

John Piper, author of What’s the Difference?: Manhood and Womanhood Defined According to the Bible, explained why men, and not women, should be the leaders in their homes and the church.. “The Bible really cares about the dynamic between men and women. It has nothing to do with a woman’s incompetency,” Piper said during a 40-minute Q&A session at a recent seminar, “Let the Nations Be Glad!” organized by the Desiring God ministry.. “A man’s headship in the home is not based on his being superiorly competency,” said Piper, the pastor for preaching at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minn., as he responded to the question of what’s the place of women in missions.. Men are not superior, Piper said.	“She is more competent than you [men] in most ways.” He said a wife could be smarter, more read, and know her Bible better than her husband. “This has to do with God’s created dynamic of what a man is and what a woman is in their gut with regard to the ballet of leadership and submission.”	['none', 'topical', 'none', 'none', 'none']

First: After the world-wide flood of Noah’s day, God instituted capital punishment (see Genesis 9:6). This sovereign commandment was given to the countries of the world to restrain murder, manslaughter, and various premeditated acts of violence. (All these sins were the underlying cause for Noah’s flood, the judgment of God.) This commandment was to be enforced in righteousness and equity for the good of all mankind. So who gave the right to take life? God did, and that to His authorized, delegated authorities.	Second: Euthanasia is the final thrust of the three-pong attack upon another God ordained institution: the family. The first thrust of attack upon the family was the slaughter of the unborn: abortion. Abortion, in all its forms, “frees” us to live immorally without dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. The unborn are murdered from, and in, the womb. The second thrust of attack occurred when the High Court of Canada legalized same sex-marriage. One of the main God-intended blessings of marriage is the procreation of children: “be fruitful and multiply.” Two men or two women can not reproduce, no matter how hard they try!

Here’s a list of 11 amazing things that will happen when you start consuming it.. 1. It helps normalize blood sugar. Pink Himalayan salt contains a whopping 84 minerals, including magnesium, manganese, vanadium and chromium to aid in normalizing your blood sugar. Magnesium is necessary for the digestion of sugar and starches. Manganese is often used to treat diabetes, as it helps to keep blood glucose levels in a normal range. Vanadium has also been shown to be beneficial in treating people with diabetes by reducing the requirements for insulin. Chromium is needed for the regulation of insulin and helps with its production.. 2. It prevents muscle cramps. Muscle cramps are painful and totally preventable. They usually happen because the body is lacking fluids (we’ve all worked out without hydrating enough) and important minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium. Calcium and magnesium are particularly important for the prevention of muscle cramps.. Pink Himalayan salt also balances electrolytes. Do yourself a favor: drink plenty of water, and — if you can stand the taste of it — add just a small amount of salt to your water for a much-needed boost.. 3. It helps with proper digestion. Pink Himalayan salt is a great nutrient to help with proper digestion of food through the entire intestinal tract. It stimulates the salivary glands in the mouth to produce amylase, which begins to digest the starch from foods right then. In the stomach, the salt stimulates hydrochloric acid and an enzyme that helps with the digestion of protein. When your food can be properly digested in the stomach, toxins will be removed, and your small and large intestines will be better able to absorb nutrients from food as it passes through.. 4. It is beneficial for dental health. We’ve all heard it before: cavities can create other health problems in the body due to the inflammation and toxins that are trapped in your mouth. Dental hygiene is especially important for our Western society where sugar is added to almost everything. To help with your dental health, you may choose to use a Pink Himalayan salt and water solution called “sole” to brush your teeth. It contains potassium which prevents gums from bleeding, while the calcium whitens and strengthens your teeth.. 5. It promotes vascular health. All kinds of issues are included in the creation of cardiovascular disease, such as a bad diet (which leads to increased body fat) or stress, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Unfortunately, the standard American diet isn’t helping, since we are bombarded with foods that are high in table salt. The salt you are used to is stripped of valuable minerals and its altered sodium chloride content actually makes it quite toxic for the human body.. However, the minerals in Pink Himalayan salt — specifically calcium and magnesium — prevent high blood pressure, which in turn promotes a healthy cardiovascular system. Of course, the benefits of this salt should be enjoyed as part of an overall real food diet and healthy lifestyle for overall better health.. 6. It can be used to treat ear infections. Ear infections, when not treated immediately and correctly, can cause serious problems and even hearing loss. Luckily, a brine solution of Pink Himalayan salt and water can be used to help treat ear infections. First, the salt has antibacterial and antiviral properties. It also makes the cell walls of bacteria expand, causing them to bloat and become weaker. The body now has an easier time attacking the infection and ridding itself of the pathogens.. 7. It helps with menstrual issues. Ladies: have you ever experienced intense cravings for chocolate during your period? This is actually your body’s way of telling you that it needs magnesium, a naturally occurring mineral in chocolate. Magnesium helps relieve cramps, so drinking some Pink Himalayan salt in your water can be helpful. You may also choose to purchase a salt sachet, warm it up and place it on your belly. Of course, we’re all in favor of a piece of dark chocolate here and there, but go ahead and give salt a try the next time a big craving hits.. 8. It eases a headache. There are plenty of remedies on the market for headaches, from medications to essential oils. If you don’t have any of those things at home, however, a water and salt “sole” solution may be just what you need. Once you mix proper parts water and salt, all you need is to massage the solution onto your head and neck. A cold compress in the neck can also be helpful.. 9. It promotes a healthy pH balance. In order to function ideally, our body cells need to be in a slight alkaline condition. The many minerals contained in Himalayan salt are a great way to help balance your pH and remove heavy metals from the body.. 10. It regulates sleep. As mentioned, Pink Himalayan salt helps with blood sugar regulation, plus it contains magnesium which has been shown to help promote feelings of calm. This combination is a great way to promote better sleep. At night before bed, either drink Himalayan salt in a glass of water or add it to a favorite nighttime beverage. Add just enough salt so that the solution is not overwhelming.. 11. It promotes a healthy libido.	If all of the reasons above are not enough to incorporate Pink Himalayan salt into your diet, maybe this one will do the trick. If you suffer from low libido and can’t seem to figure out the cause, you may be lacking in some important minerals that increase sex drive such as selenium, zinc and magnesium. All the more reason to incorporate it into your daily routine..	['none', 'intent', 'none', 'none', 'none']

When you consume DE, you can look forward to many benefits. Even better, this parasite cleansing gut powder has no taste. If you’ve tried other gut powder products in the past, you can probably attest to their nasty taste.. That’s a non-issue with Diatomaceous Earth. Sure, it’s a little on the gritty side and its chalky makeup reminds you of chalk, but that’s to be expected. Other than that, you can comfortably ingest DE without disrupting your palate.. Once in your body, DE gets to work. Let’s take a moment to discuss what you can expect from this powerful product.. Reduced Serum Cholesterol. One study revealed that taking Diatomaceous Earth for just 6 weeks can help to significantly reduce the cholesterol in your bloodstream. As such, you should seriously consider investing in this supplement if you struggle with cholesterol issues.. Cholesterol is frequently connected to heart disease. This is due to low-density lipoproteins (LDL) that can gradually build up in your arteries, thereby restricting or even blocking your blood flow. While it’s true that you need small amounts of cholesterol to properly digest foods and to make certain hormones and vitamin D, too much can lead to heart problems.. Cholesterol is a kind of fat known as a lipid. This lipid travels through your body’s bloodstream in small molecules that are enclosed within proteins, known as lipoproteins. There are two types of lipoproteins in your body. One of these is LDL, which is the main type of lipoprotein in your bloodstream.. The other is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL). There is also a third type of lipid that circulates in your blood called a triglyceride. LDL is considered to be bad cholesterol, while HDL is good cholesterol.. To determine your serum cholesterol level, you need to measure your LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. This will give you your body’s total blood cholesterol level. And in doing so, your doctor will be able to determine your risk of getting heart disease for the next 10 years.. Regardless of whether you are currently at risk of developing heart disease, taking Diatomaceous Earth now could potentially prolong your heart health.. Another big plus of DE is that it is rich in silica content. What is silica? It is an essential micronutrient that’s needed for healthy hair and nail growth. But that’s not all silica is good for, as it also plays a big role in aiding your body’s calcium and magnesium balance.. Long-term Diatomaceous Earth consumption will ultimately help keep your hormones in check. And if you are already taking collagen for healthy skin, nails, and hair, Diatomaceous Earth’s silica will assist in your body’s collagen formation.. If you’re wondering how food-grade DE is rich in silica, it is because silica is naturally found in mineral quartz, sandstone, and other various types of rocks. Being mined from the bottom of dried lake beds, it makes sense that Diatomaceous Earth contains high amounts of silica.. Diatomaceous Earth is a versatile compound that also serves as an excellent exfoliant. Thanks to its rich mineral makeup and gritty composition, you can mix it with your favorite shower gel to create a powerful facial cleansing formula.. Simply mix about half a teaspoon into your body or face wash.	Then, clean your face using soft circular motions. Scrubbing too hard can cause the skin on your face to get too oily. Furthermore, the rough grittiness may not feel very nice if you aren’t extra gentle during use as a facial cleanser..	['none', 'intent', 'none', 'none', 'none']

The normal blood pressure range is between 120/80 mm Hg or lower.. Elevated Blood Pressure is something that is not equal to normal blood pressure. It is slightly high when compared to normal blood pressure. It requires slight concern as the cause can be different every time. The blood pressure will be around 120-129 mm hg at this stage, and the bottom number is not above 80 mm Hg.. The blood pressure level is immensely increased at this stage compared to the normal and elevated stages. It requires immediate action and treatment as it can worsen the case. The blood pressure at this stage is 130 to 149 mm Hg, and the bottom number is 80 and 89..	It is the highest stage of blood pressure, the worst of all. It is the most severe blood pressure stage which is the worst and can lead to severe complications. This type of blood pressure requires a strict diet, efficient care, and proper treatment. In this stage, the blood pressure is 140 mm Hg, and the bottom number is 90 mm Hg.. Hypertensive crisis Pressure is a form of blood pressure that is extremely serious and can cause severe complications if not treated with appropriate care. In this stage, your blood pressure will be 180/120 or higher than other forms of blood pressure..	['none', 'none', 'none', 'none', 'none']

The following un-American bills are being considered by Congress and sponsored by Democrats:	- 01.06.09 – Disarm them –Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act (HR 45) – Introduced byRep. Bobby Rush [D, IL-1] – The Blair Holt’s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act would establish a nationwide system for prohibiting unlicensed gun-ownership. If approved, the law would require gun owners to apply for five-year licenses to own firearms, and would give the U.S. Attorney General broad authority over the program. There are no co-sponsors to the bill, and there is very little chance it will be adopted.. - 01.08.09 – Tax their food –Food Safety Enhancement Act (HR 2749) – Introduced byRep. John Dingell [D, MI-15] – This bill proposes greater FDA regulatory powers over the national food supply and food providers, namely granting it the authority to regulate how crops are raised and harvested, to quarantine a geographic area, to make warrantless searches of business records, and to establish a national food tracing system. Concurrently, the bill would impose annual registration fees of $500 on all facilities holding, processing, or manufacturing food and require that such facilities also engaged in the transport or packing of food maintain pedigrees of the origin and previous distribution history of the food. The bill is an enhancement toH.R.759, and to a lesser extent, H.R. 857, previously proposed food safety bills in the 111th Congress. It is also co-sponsored by the same Representatives as the latter two bills, although new to the line of support isRep. Henry Waxman, chair of the House Energy and Commerce committee.. - 01.26.09 – Bankrupt them –American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (HR 1) – Introduced byRep.

John Rockefeller [D, WV] – A bill to ensure the continued free flow of commerce within the United States and with its global trading partners through secure cyber communications, to provide for the continued development and exploitation of the Internet and intranet communications for such purposes, to provide for the development of a cadre of information technology specialists to improve and maintain effective cybersecurity defenses against disruption, and for other purposes.. - 05.15.09 – Tax their energy –American Clean Energy and Security Act (HR 2454) – Introduced byRep. Henry Waxman [D, CA-30] and has passed the House (06.26.09) – This is the Waxman-Markley comprehensive energy bill, known for short as “ACES,” that includes a cap-and-trade global warming reduction plan designed to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020. Other provisions include new renewable requirements for utilities, studies and incentives regarding new carbon capture and sequestration technologies, energy efficiency incentives for homes and buildings, and grants for green jobs, among other things.. - 06.15.09 – Brand them –The Pass ID Act (S 1261) – Introduced by Sen. Daniel Akaka [D, HI] – This bill seeks to set out minimum requirements for State driver’s licenses and ID cards regarding what data is included and what documentation must be presented when receiving such ID cards. In turn, it would shift a degree of authority from the State to the Federal level by prohibiting a Federal agency from accepting, for any official purposes, a State ID card unless that State it is materially compliant with this bill’s minimum requirements..
